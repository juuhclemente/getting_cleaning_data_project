# getting_cleaning_data_project
Final project for getting and cleaning data coursera couse, which can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/.

This Project has two main docs:

## codebook.rmd

Brings the step by step in the transformations performed by run_analysis.R, and explains the role of the different files in this project.

## run_analysis.R Script

The `run_analysis.R` script aims to accomplish the following goals:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
